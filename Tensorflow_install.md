# **Guide to Installing and Running TensorFlow**

1. Verify the workstations hardware capabilities. This is in order to determine if the workstation can run either the CPU or GPU based version of TensorFlow. Both versions work, however the GPU based version will allow for faster processing capability.

2. Determine if you would like to run TensorFlow in Python or Anaconda. Python 3.6 worked with little to no problems and a slightly more simplified installation process when compared to Anaconda. 

3. Fallow the steps that are given at the following URL

4. Once TensorFlow is installed, visit the following URL and follow the coding instructions to run tfClassifier. This will be used to actually identify the image file content.

5. In the command prompt environment and running tfClassifier, execute the following command:

   Python classifier.py --image_file image_file_path

6. Helpful note:

   Ensure that you executing commands in while in the correct folder. Similarly, ensure image file path from tfClassifier to the image is also correct.
